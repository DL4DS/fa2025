Despite increased adoption, effective subtitle segmentation poses a challenge, par-
ticularly in libre-software contexts. Our research addresses this gap by proposing a
reliable subtitle segmentation solution, leveraging deep learning techniques to advance
comprehension, streamline academic processes, and reduce dependence on proprietary
solutions and volunteer efforts.
