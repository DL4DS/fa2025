Car crash detection is a critical application of AI-driven traffic surveillance, enabling real-time accident identification and response. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system that detects car crashes from video and audio data using multimodal approaches. We will integrate computer vision techniques for video analysis, optical flow for motion tracking, autoencoders for anomaly detection, and audio classification for crash sound recognition. Our approach will leverage multiple datasets, including DoTA, UCF-Crime (road accidents), and BDD100K (normal driving footage). The final system will be evaluated based on precision, recall, and the Spatial-Temporal Area Under Curve (STAUC) metric.
