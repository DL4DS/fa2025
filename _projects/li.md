Increasing output in the volume of academic publications over the years will inevitably lead to problems when it comes to allowing a user to be able to pick out papers
that are relevant and/or useful to them, with citations being the only sense of structure
one can rely on. Incidentally, graph neural networks has seen a recent surge in interest
and developments, presenting new ways to apply deep learning techniques on data that
can be represented in the structure of a graph. This project explores graph neural networks and the task of link prediction in creating a recommendation system that, given
a paper/topic, will provide users with a suggested sequence of papers to read in order
to further understand the paper/topic, ultimately assisting users in navigating the ever
increasingly complex landscape of academic publications. The code can be found at this
repository or at the url: https://github.com/lib250/publication-recommender.
