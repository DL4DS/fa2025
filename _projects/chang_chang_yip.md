We aim to create a labeled dataset of contract clauses that will serve as a foundation for 
training and evaluating AI models in legal contract NLP. By curating and annotating contracts with a focus on clause categorization and summarization, our dataset will contribute to the development of AI-driven tools for contract analysis and verification.
