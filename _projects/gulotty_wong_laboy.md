This project aims to develop a fine-tuned language model that demonstrates ex-
plicit chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities for solving mathematical problems. By
training a Deepseek-7B model on the GSM8K dataset with step-by-step reasoning an-
notations, we seek to create an AI system that not only produces correct answers but
also transparently explains its problem-solving process, similar to how students show
their work in educational settings.
