This project explores Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) using deep learning, focusing on the CUB-200-2011 dataset. We aim to develop a model leveraging
ResNet50 as a baseline, with improvements from attention mechanisms and Supervised Contrastive Learning to enhance classification accuracy and interpretability.
