How do deep learning models select important features and when can they be wrong? Spurious
correlations arise when models learn to rely upon features which are correlated with the target but
ultimately don’t have any general predictive value. In this project I explore this effect in synthetic
datasets with the goal of creating simple settings where models can fail, and understanding current
methods for ﬁxing them.
