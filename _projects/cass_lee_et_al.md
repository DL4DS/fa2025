The objective of the research is to propose a novel Multimodal and Multiscale model
for the classification and segmentation of brain tumors on Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) images. We carefully analyze the Brain Tumor Segmentation(BraTS) 2021
Dataset with the intention of leveraging these images for diagnostic purposes. Here is
the link to our project repository: https://github.com/cassielee04/smart brains.
We found that the multi-modality model performed better than the single modality
model for the who brain tumor segmentation task in BraTS.
