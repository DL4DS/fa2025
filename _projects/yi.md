This project aims to develop a conditional protein generative model which can generate novel protein with amino acid sequences and 3D structures, conditioning on a specific target motif, or a functional sub unit. It will try to combine both the existing protein generative models such as EvoDiff or ProteinMPNN,  and the protein structure prediction models, such as AlphaFold or OmegaFold, to validate the structural feasibility of the new novel protein that contains the motif.
