This project will aim to model differential expression (DE) for the PBMC peripherial white blood molecular cell acorss the 144 biological compounds. PBMCs are a primary, disease-relevant tissue that contains multiple mature cell types (including T-cells, B-cells, Myeloid cells, and NK cells) with established markers for annotation of cell types. We want to estimate the impact of an experimental perturbation on the expression level of every 18211 gene in the transcription.
