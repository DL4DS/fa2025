We propose VideoASL, an innovative approach to isolated sign language recognition
(ISLR) from video. Using a two-pronged approach, our model uses video features with
hand landmark locations to recognize large-scale American Sign Language (ASL). We
aim to address challenges in dictionary retrieval, which are essential tools for language
learners and users. Potential applications include live sign transcription, as well as
creating a reliable ASL-to-English dictionary.
