This project proposes a smart multimodal classroom video recording system that automatically composes multiple content streams—camera feeds, slides, and white-board—based on real-time cues like gestures and spoken references. By leveraging computer vision, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and content analysis, it can dynamically pan, zoom, and switch between sources to create a more engaging, context-aware lecture recording. The goal is to overcome the limitations of static cameras and provide a richer, more immersive experience for both live and recorded viewers.
