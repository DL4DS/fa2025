Storyboarding is an essential process in films, animations, and comics, providing
a structured visual representation of narratives before production begins. However,
traditional storyboard creation is time-consuming and requires artistic expertise. This
project introduces an AI-powered storyboard generator that leverages prompt-based
diffusion models and large language models (LLMs). The system will automate the
creation of frame-by-frame storyboards by collecting and processing comic and storyboard datasets, generating scene descriptions using image captioning models, and
fine-tuning a diffusion model for sequential image generation. The approach follows
an agent-based architecture, where frames are generated iteratively to ensure narrative
coherence. This project builds upon research in script-to-storyboard automation, generative storytelling, and AI-assisted animation, enhancing efficiency, accessibility, and
creative possibilities in storyboard creation.
