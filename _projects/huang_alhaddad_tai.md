This project aims to improve open-vocabulary grounding segmentation using the LPCVC 2025 dataset and model framework. We will start by reproducing the sample code provided and then enhance it using Focal-T / ViT-b models trained on COCO and evaluated on RefCOCOg. Our goal is to refine segmentation performance by experimenting with different model improvements, such as fine-tuning strategies and data augmentation.
