Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder known for being the primary cause of dementia, characterized by significant memory loss and cognitive decline. This project aims to develop a deep learning model, trained on 3D T1-weighted structural MRI scans, that analyzes structural patterns in memory related regions of the brain in order to predict AD onset. The model will be refined using insights from activation maps of established models in order to enhance accuracy and consistency, with an end goal to improve early detection and provide an more interpretable and reliable approach to predicting Alzheimer’s.
