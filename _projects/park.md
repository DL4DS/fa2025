This research proposes a deep neural network model that predicts global wheat
crop yield using time-series data of global weather, aiming to address the inefficiencies
of current region-specific models. To this end, a combination of CNN (Convolutional
Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks is implemented,
where the CNN block processes encode input images and the LSTM block play a role
in predicting wheat crop yield in an auto-regressive manner. This model is meaningful
in that it predicts the global crop field and uses a spatiotemporal approach.
