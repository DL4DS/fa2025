This project aims to develop a deep learning-based music recommen- dation system using content-based filtering to suggest relevant music to users according to distinct characteristics, such as danceability, tempo, and energy. By training neural networks on these features, the model will map songs to a latent space where similar music is categorized. Essentially, this project demonstrates the feasibility of personalizing music discovery using AI and contributes to the improvement of overall recommendation systems.
