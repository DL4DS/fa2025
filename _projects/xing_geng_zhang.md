This project proposes a real-time framework for enhancing image clarity in localized regions by integrating YOLOv8 for object detection and a lightweight super-resolution (SR) model. Targeting applications such as video conferencing and live streaming, the system dynamically identifies regions of interest (e.g., human subjects) and applies adaptive SR enhancement while maintaining a processing speed of 30+ FPS on consumer-grade GPUs. Our approach balances computational efficiency and perceptual quality through model optimization and/or hardware acceleration.
