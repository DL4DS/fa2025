Deep learning for radiologic image analysis is a rapidly growing field in biomedical research and is likely to become a standard practice in modern medicine. The authors will use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing X-Ray images that are classified by the presence or absence of pneumonia to make a neural network that is as accurate at diagnosing pneumonia as trained radiologists. Success of the model will be determined by the algorithmâ€™s F1 score as it is a standard parameter to evaluate machine learning models.
