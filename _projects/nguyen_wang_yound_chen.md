In this project, we will explore research on the interface of machine learning and Physics. More specifically, we will attempt to recreate the plots of the papers published by Sharma et al. and Nguyen et al., and then test their models on unseen astrophysical data. To make sure that our recreations are accurate, we will compare them qualitatively with the plots from the papers and show consistency with the theory when we test this on unseen experimental data. The end goal of our project will be a report on the success of our model recreation as well as a pedagogical presentation to shed light on this emerging field of study.
