Rock climbing is a sport of problem-solving, especially in bouldering. The Kilter board is a standardized training board specifically for bouldering, and for many climbers, reading where to put their hands and feet is a struggle at first: this tool will read the routes and give the optimal path for the climber to attempt. In addition, based on the given routes, the tool will generate similar routes based on a given grade that a climber selects.
