This study aims to develop predictive models for mortality rates among critical care
patients using neural networks, utilizing large-scale healthcare data from the United
States. Additionally, we conduct comparative analysis with classical machine learning techniques. While acknowledging the limitations of generalizing findings to other
healthcare systems, we emphasize the significance of accurately predicting mortality
rates for informed resource allocation and quality assessment in intensive care settings
