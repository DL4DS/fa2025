This project aims to develop a lightweight, efficient model for monocular depth
estimation that runs smoothly on mobile systems. By using techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, along with efficient architectures such as
MobileNetV3 and depth-wise separable convolutions, we strive to achieve fast inference
without compromising depth accuracy.
