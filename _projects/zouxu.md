This report presents an in-depth exploration of advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies tailored for text detection and recognition in poker videos, a challenging domain due to dynamic visual elements
and diverse textual representations. We address significant hurdles such as
varying font styles, background complexity, and multilingual text present in
real-time video streams. The research utilizes a dual-phase approach where
text is first detected using DBNet, a robust detector capable of identifying
text within highly cluttered images, and subsequently recognized through a
Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), which excels in decoding text from irregular patterns. Our findings demonstrate that integrating these technologies can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency
of text recognition in poker videos. By refining detection and recognition
phases, the system achieves superior performance compared to traditional
OCR systems. The practical implications of this study extend beyond gaming, offering potential applications in various multimedia and real-time video
processing tasks where accurate text recognition is critical.
