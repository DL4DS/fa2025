Deep learning has significantly advanced how it solve complex problems in
various areas like image recognition, language processing, and healthcare. Particularly, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can analyze
large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make decisions, improving tasks
like diagnosing diseases or translating languages.
Our project applies these advanced technologies to help elderly people stay
safe in their homes. The elderly is at risk of falling, and if the falling situations
are not detected on time, they can lead to serious health problems or even be
fatal. By creating a system that uses deep learning to monitor and detect when
an elderly person falls, it can alert family members or emergency services right
away, potentially saving lives.
