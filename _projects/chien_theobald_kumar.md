Bone fractures are a significant healthcare challenge, requiring timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. However, radiographic interpretation remains prone to variability and depends heavily on specialized expertise, limiting access to quality care in resource-constrained settings. Recent advances in LLM and computer vision offer promising solutions for automating fracture detection and classification. In this study, we develop an LLM-powered ChatBot integrated with a graph segmentation model for fracture diagnosis, leveraging computer vision to analyze medical images.
