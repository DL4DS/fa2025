Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are characterized by
the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. These
diseases are among the most challenging conditions to diagnose and treat, primarily because
they often develop silently and become apparent only when significant neurological damage has
occurred. The diagnosis is crucial as it can lead to more effective management of the disease,
potentially slowing its progression and significantly improving the quality of life for patients . This
early detection is pivotal as it could allow for timely intervention, potentially altering the disease's
trajectory.
