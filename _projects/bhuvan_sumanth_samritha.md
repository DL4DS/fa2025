This project aims to develop a deep learning model for real-time cricket commentary using video highlights. We leverage Whisper for speech-to-text transcription of existing commentary and LLaVA for generating context-aware commentary. Training on structured cricket event data ensures accuracy and engagement, advancing automated sports broadcasting with vision-language modeling.
