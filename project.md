Here's your chance to apply the deep learning techniques you learn in this 
class to real world applications.

> Note: we're modeling our project definition on Prof. Andrew Ng's 
> CS230 Deep Learning class.

## Project Categories

Choose a project that aligns with your interests and utilizes deep learning
as part of the solution.

You may pick one of the three following categoies of projects.

- **Application Project:** We expect most students will pick this category. Pick a
  problem or application that interests you. Consider whether there are suitable
  datasets available already or whether you will have to augment or create a 
  dataset. Outcomes are expected to be implementation with an accompanying
  github repo and a report.
- **Algorithmic Project:** In this category, you will develop a new deep learning
  algorithm or substantively improve an existing one. One would typically
  benchmark against some well known dataset and show non-trivial improvement
  over prior work. Outcomes would typically be a short conference style 
  article and an implementation with a github repo.
- **Theoretical Project:** Prove an interesting property of a new or existing 
  learning algorithm. For a purely theoretical project, the output may only be
  a conference style report, but an implementation (and accompanying GitHub repo)
  may be appropriate as well.

It's possible that your project may blend more than one category.

## Project Topics

Design a project that piques your interest. The more the project aligns with
your interest, the more invested you will be in it and the more effort you will
likely put into it. Maybe you want to work on something that brings social 
benefit, or perhaps you want to prototpye a potential future commercial venture!
It's ok to be ambitious and aim high.

Having said that, the project is time bound so do your best to scope it to fit
in the semester timeline. Some factors that may impact the scope:

1. Is there an existing, labeled dataset that you can use? Or will you have to
   create one from scratch? Creating and labeling a dataset is a great experience
   but can be quite time consuming. On the other hand, one way to get attention
   to a problem or application is to provide an interesting dataset and invite
   the community to propose solutions.
2. Will you be simply prompting an existing model, or fine-tuning a pre-trained
   model, or training a new model from scratch. The three approaches are
   increasingly time consuming.
3. Is the problem or application amenable to deep learning solutions? This can 
   sometimes be hard to assess without experimenting, but one trick is to reflect
   on how hard it would be for a person to solve the problem. Generally, if a
   person can do the task very quickly (think classify dog versus cat), then there's
   a good chance a deep learning model can be applied. Of course LLMs can be
   counterintuitive in this regard.

We encourage you to bounce ideas off the instructor and the TA. We can help you
brainstorm your project ideas and help estimate the scope.

There are places you can look to help give you ideas:

1. Application workshops at major conferences can be good sources of ideas. Often
   times they are associated with new and interesting datasets. Some potential
   conferences include: 
    1. [NeurIps](https://nips.cc/),
    2. [CVPR](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/),
    3. [ICML](https://icml.cc/),
    4. [ICMLA](https://www.icmla-conference.org/),
    5. [SPIE](https://spie.org/opo/conferencedetails/applications-of-machine-learning)
2. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and other competition websites can be a
    source of ideas.
3. You might find some interesting datasets at 
   [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets)
4. Lot of applications are posted on X/Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.

In case it is helpful, here are some project ideas you can also consider:
1. Class AI Tutor
2. Teacher's Assistant
3. NAACP/WGBH bias detection
4. Herbaria Foundation Model
5. _more to come_

We'll expand on each of these later.

## Project Deliverables


### Proposal
**Deadline:** February 16, Friday 11:59 PM

Submission will be on GradeScope. The information requested will be:
* Project Tilte
* Project Category
* Team Members 
* What is the problem you are solving or application you are developing?
* What dataset will you be using? Does it exist already? What dataset preparation will be needed?
* What algorithms and models do you plan to use? Do they exist already?
  It's ok if the solution evolves as you learn more.
* What papers and references are relevant to your project.
* What kind of results and outcome do you expect? How will you evaluate them?


### Mid-Project Checkin
**Deadline:** March 29, Friday 11:59 PM

Provide a status update on the project.

More instructions to come.

### Video
**Deadline:** April 30, Tuesday 11:59 PM

Create a 3-4 minute video (no more than 4 minutes) that describe your
project. Generally, the video should include:
1. Introduce the team
2. State the problem or application and why it is important
3. Provide the approach taken, models and methods used
4. Show the results and how evaluated

### Final Report and Presentation
**Deadline:** April 30, Tuesday 11:59 PM

Instructions to be provided.
