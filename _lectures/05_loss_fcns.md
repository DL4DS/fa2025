title: 05 - Loss Functions
tldr: "We reconsider loss functions as a measure of how well the data fits to
parametric probability distribution. We show that for univariate gaussian
distributions we arrive back at least squares loss. We then introduce the notion
of maximum likelihood and see how we can use that to define loss functions for
many types data distributions. We cover some examples and then show how to generalize.
This is a key topic to aid you in applying deep learning models to new types of data."
