title: 17 -- Unsupervised Learning and GANs
tldr: "In this lecture we revisit the concept of unsupervised learning in the
context of generative models. 
We will then dive into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their applications. 
We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of GANs and some of the recent advances in the field."
