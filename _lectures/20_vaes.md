title: 20 - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
tldr: "In this lecture we dive into Variational Autoencoders or VAEs. We
start by looking at autoencoders and their ability to reduce dimensions of
inputs into a latent space. We'll see why they don't make good generative 
models and then generalize to VAEs. We'll finish with some examples of 
generative output of VAEs."
